## ‚ú® Usage

### ‚û§ Client-side

```ts
import { ApiService } from "@alyvro/api-service";
import { cache, compressor } from "@alyvro/api-service/plugins";

const api = new ApiService({
  api_url: "https://your-backend.com/api",
});

api.client.request.post(
  "/user",
  { index: "foo" },
  {
    secret: {
      body: true,
    },
    plugins: {
      cache,
      compressor,
    },
  }
);
```

- `cache` ‚Üí stores and reuses previous responses to reduce duplicate requests (client & server safe)
- `compressor` ‚Üí automatically compresses/decompresses payloads when supported by the server

---

### ‚û§ Server-side (Express)

```ts
import express from "express";
import { ApiService } from "@alyvro/api-service";

const app = express();

const api = new ApiService({
  api_url: "https://your-backend.com/api",
  settings: {
    /* set TELEGRAM_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID in your env file if you set telegram:true */
    telegram: true,
  },
});

// middleware with plugins
app.use((req, res, next) =>
  api.server.middleware(req, res, next, {
    cache: true, // enables server-side response caching
  })
);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Hello world!" });
});
```

When an error occurs, it will be automatically sent to your Telegram.

## üß© Plugins

The new **Plugin System** allows extending the functionality of requests and middleware.

### Built-in Plugins

- **Cache**  
  Stores last response and prevents duplicate requests with identical payloads.

  - Client: prevents duplicate `POST/GET` calls
  - Server: can be enabled via `cache: true` in `middleware`

- **Compressor**
  - Client: sends requests in compressed form if supported
  - Server: automatically decompresses incoming gzip payloads and compresses JSON responses when the client supports gzip
